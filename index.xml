I am a 17 year old from Lithuania that loves everything around web development
Writing code for 3 years and counting
Education I have completed the Harvard&amp;rsquo;s CS50 course
I am currently in the senior year of high school ðŸ˜°
What I like Open Source, I believe that truly secure &amp;amp; fast software can only be open source Customization, I love customizing linux (KDE) &amp;amp; will always choose fancy color palettes for my apps Typescript, The intellisense it gives you is just wow React, react sometimes gets a lot of hate, but with react 18 and new features like Suspense for data fetching and concurrency, I am truly glad I chose this framework Node, it&amp;rsquo;s faster than I initially thought MongoDB, The stuff you can do with aggregation is literally infinite Redis, caching data just seems so oddly satisfying to me, those &amp;lt;50ms response times Fastify, the express killer ?</description></item><item><title>Test</title><link>/posts/test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/test/</guid><description>Test</description></item><item><title>Uses</title><link>/uses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/uses/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
