Hey, my name is Donatas, but I go by the nickname "Tronikel" on most websites

I am a 17 year old from Lithuania that loves everything around web development

Writing code for 3 years and counting

## Education

I have completed the Harvard's [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) course

I am currently in the senior year of high school ðŸ˜°

## What I like

1. **Open Source**, I believe that truly secure & fast software can only be open source
2. **Customization**, I love customizing linux (KDE) & will always choose fancy color palettes for my apps
3. **Typescript**, The intellisense it gives you is just wow
4. **React**, react sometimes gets a lot of hate, but with react 18 and new features like Suspense for data fetching and concurrency, I am truly glad I chose this framework
5. **Node**, it's faster than I initially thought
6. **MongoDB**, The stuff you can do with aggregation is literally infinite
7. **Redis**, caching data just seems so oddly satisfying to me, those <50ms response times
8. **Fastify**, the express killer ?
9. **Material UI**, @mui/material from npm
